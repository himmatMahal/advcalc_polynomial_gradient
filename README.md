# advcalc_polynomial_gradient
A Python GUI program to graph an approximation of the gradient vectors
of a 3-D Polynomial function

## Description
Program uses python math library SymPy to differentiate a given polynomial,
then graphs the Gradient of the function over interval [-5,5] x [-5,5],
with colors, as well as arrow length to represent the magnitude of a vector.
